# Video-Memorability-Prediction
Predicting video memorability using various features of a video.

•	Built regression models for the predictive modelling of video memorability using Python <br/>
•	Compared accuracy of the best model (Random Forest Regression) using different features:<br/> (i) Captions<br/> (ii) C3D values<br/> (iii) Captions and C3D values <br/>
•	Outcome – <br/>The most accurate version of the Random Forest model predicted with 87.55% accuracy (case (iii))
